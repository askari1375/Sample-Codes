## Crawler

Python code that can crawl [this](https://searchingfortruth.ir/) website was written for this project. This code's objective is to create a Latex file from articles on this website. Running this code will produce a ".tex" file that can be used by a Latex compiler. To achieve this, the following tasks had been completed:

1. Using the [Scrapy framework](https://scrapy.org/), a crawler was created to read website articles.

2. The outcome of the preceding step needs to be processed because it is not clean enough.

3. The entire text should be combined in the proper Latex format.
